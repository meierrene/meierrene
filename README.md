👋 Greetings!

I'm René, 34 years old. I'm becoming a fullstack Dev and very excited for programming. My first contact with programming was when I studied Mechanical Engineering with <code>.c</code> language in 2008. After several years I've decided to go deeper for programming. Then I got some skills from Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. And even started some little projects. Actually I'm searching for homework jobs to get even better.

Summarizing...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning <code>.js</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.java</code>, <code>NodeJS</code>, <code>MongoDB</code>;
- 🖼️ And some frameworks like: <code>Bootstrap</code>, <code>jQuery</code>, <code>Node express</code>, <code>Mongoose</code>, and so on...
