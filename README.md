ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

I'm RenÃ©, 33 years old. Actually I'm working as a Airline Pilot. But I'm newbie and excited to programming. My first contact with programming was when I was studying Mechanical Engineering with C language in 2008. After several years I've decided to go deeper for programming. Then I got some knowledgement from Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. And even started some little projects. Actually I'm searching for homework jobs to get even better.

Resuming...
